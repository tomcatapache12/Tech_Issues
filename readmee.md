## ✅ **Additional Tasks/Improvements Added:**
✔️ Added retry, logging, and error-handling for inbound and outbound flow.  
✔️ Added fallback and alerting for ACK handling.  
✔️ Added monitoring, scalability, and DR strategy to operational readiness.  
✔️ Strengthened contract definition for outbound flows.  
✔️ Included post-mortem and playbook creation for handling failures.  

---

## 🏆 **Why This Format Works:**
✅ Clean and structured for GitHub/Confluence.  
✅ Easy to track progress and outcomes.  
✅ Covers technical, operational, and business goals.  
✅ Scalable and extensible for future enhancements.
