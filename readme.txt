Last year, I created a ticket to migrate all existing QA AppProxy load balancers to the new iBoss LB URL. I see that most of them have been completed, except for one assigned to Impreetâ€”could you please confirm its status?

Additionally, it appears that some applications in the liquidity environment are still using direct hostnames instead of the Proxy LB URL.

To address this, I am looping in the relevant team members to review the repositories and ensure that all applications are updated accordingly.

Let me know if you need any further details.
