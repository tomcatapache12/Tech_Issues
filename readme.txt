Subject: Information Required for Mosaic Platform Resiliency & Scaling Assessment â€“ BofA Onboarding

Hi [Product Team/Name],

As part of onboarding BofA onto the Mosaic platform, Iâ€™ve started evaluating our system's readiness from a scalability and resiliency standpoint.

To proceed with the assessment and ensure we are prepared for the expected load from BofA usage, Iâ€™d appreciate your inputs on the following:

ðŸ“Œ Information Required
User Load
How many total BofA users will be onboarded into Mosaic?

What is the maximum number of users expected to be active concurrently?

Trade Volume & Submission
What is the estimated number of trades BofA will place per day?

What is the expected peak trade volume per:

Hour?

Minute?

When using the batch upload feature, what is the maximum number of trades expected in a single batch?

SOA Report â€“ Account Coverage
How many accounts will be used by BofA to place trades?

(We will use the same set of accounts to generate and send the daily Statement of Account.)

âœ… Confirmation Points
Please confirm the following assumptions:

BofA will be using only the Mosaic UI as the trading channel (not file-based or API submission).

The only reporting types required for BofA are:

Intraday acknowledgements

Statement of Account (SOA)

In terms of GS offshore/onshore and non-GS offshore/onshore, do we have any sense of which fund types BofA will trade more actively?

Even an approximate percentage split would help.

These details will help us proactively identify any scaling or resilience enhancements required before BofA usage scales up.

Please let me know if anything needs clarification.
Looping in [Your Manager's Name] for visibility.

Thanks & Regards,
Angad
