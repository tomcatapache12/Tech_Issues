Update on Local Setup:

Khushtar has made good progress and is actively working on their assigned modules.
Manandeep ran two services but wasnâ€™t able to contribute further due to other commitments. He has handed over the modules, which were running fine but still require testing.
Given the scope of testing, I am distributing the effort among multiple people in GTAM to ensure comprehensive coverage, as it would be difficult for Khushtar to handle alone.
Testing is planned for today, and we will address any issues that arise.
