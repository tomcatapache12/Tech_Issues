MoM from discussion with Jared – Cloud-related Topics

As per our recent discussion with Jared, we have aligned on a few key points regarding our approach to cloud-related improvements and collaboration across teams. Below is a summary of the discussion and shared suggestions:

Utilizing Existing AMS DataSync:
Given the current limitations and constraints within DMS, we agreed to continue leveraging the existing AMS DataSync for now. This will serve as a practical interim solution. In the future, if needed, we can explore and adopt a more long-term or scalable approach.

Creating a Common Core Repository:
We discussed the need to extract shared/common logic from AMS and move it into a centralized core-mosaic-cloud repository. This will help us ensure consistency and reduce duplication. Any future updates to common logic can then be done in one place and propagated across services.

Initiating Weekly AMS Team Syncs:
To encourage continuous knowledge sharing and team alignment, we’ve decided to start weekly catch-up sessions within the AMS team. This will be a good platform to share updates, learnings, and discuss cloud-related improvements from both AMS and the broader cloud perspective.

Future Consideration for Common Cloud Deployment Space:
We also touched on the idea of having a shared or common place for cloud deployments, which could be beneficial in the long run. While this may not be immediately required, it’s something we can explore as part of future planning.
