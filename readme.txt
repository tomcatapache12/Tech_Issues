Subject: Performance Optimization Updates and Setup Guides for GTAM and Jaeger

Dear [Group Lead's Name],

I am writing to provide an update on the performance optimization efforts we have undertaken in the GTAM service over the past two months, as well as to share valuable resources we have created to aid the team in setting up GTAM and Jaeger locally.

Key Accomplishments
Performance Optimization:

We addressed several instances of the Hibernate N+1 problem, significantly improving the efficiency of database operations across critical service flows.
Leveraging Jaeger (based on OpenTelemetry), we analyzed and optimized spans, reducing latency and enhancing the overall service performance.
Introduced parallelism in certain tasks, which further contributed to a notable improvement in system throughput.
Knowledge Sharing:

Created detailed Confluence pages to help team members set up GTAM locally, resolving many common issues that were previously encountered.
Developed a step-by-step guide for setting up Jaeger locally, making it easier to utilize this tool for telemetry and performance diagnostics.
Next Steps
To ensure the team benefits from these efforts and insights, I have consolidated the analysis and setup instructions into a single Confluence page. This page includes proven optimization techniques, detailed case studies of the N+1 problem resolutions, and the guides for GTAM and Jaeger setup.

I would appreciate it if you could share this resource with the team to enhance collaboration and streamline local development setups.

Best regards,
Angad
