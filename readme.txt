The Mosaic Contingency Platform is a lightweight backup system designed to ensure continuity of fund trade operations when the primary Mosaic platform is unavailable (e.g., due to UI outage, backend issues, or downstream failure). It enables internal Operations teams to continue trade processing through a simplified and manual file-upload mechanism.
