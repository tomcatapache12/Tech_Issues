Update on Local Setup:

Khushtar has made good progress and is actively working on their assigned modules.
Manandeep ran two services but wasn’t able to contribute further due to other commitments. He has handed over the modules, which were running fine but still require testing.
Given the scope of testing, I am distributing the effort among multiple people in GTAM to ensure comprehensive coverage, as it would be difficult for Khushtar to handle alone.
Testing is planned for today, and we will address any issues that arise.

Update on Local Setup:

Khushtar has made good progress and is actively working on their assigned modules.
Manandeep ran two services ([Module A, Module B]) but couldn’t contribute further due to other commitments. He handed over the modules, which were running fine but still require testing.
Current Status:
✅ Completed Modules (Running Fine, Need Testing):

Module A (Handled by Manandeep)
Module B (Handled by Manandeep)
Module C (Worked on by Khushtar)
⚠️ Remaining Work:

Module D (Still in progress, being worked on by Khushtar)
Module E & F (Need verification/testing)
Next Steps:
Testing is planned for today, and I am distributing the effort among multiple people in GTAM to ensure broader coverage.
If any issues arise during testing, we will debug and address them accordingly.
