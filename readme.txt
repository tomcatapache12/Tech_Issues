Dear [HR's Name],

As a follow-up to our earlier communication, I discussed the early exit with my manager. Iâ€™ve been informed that while I can utilize my remaining vacation days (with approval), the termination date will remain unchanged.

I will decide later whether to avail these vacation days.

Best regards,
Angad
