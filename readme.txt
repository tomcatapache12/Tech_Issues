Subject: Task Delegation for Local Setup Process

Hi [Team],

As discussed and concluded with [Person A] and [Person B], Iâ€™ve updated the Confluence page with a Quick Summary section that outlines the 4 key steps for setting up and running the modules locally.

The plan is to first ensure everyone is familiar with the process, then streamline it for efficiency. Here's a brief overview of the steps:

Edit build.xml
Run Ant Build
Build & Start Services
Plan for Optimization:
Familiarization Phase:

Ensure a thorough understanding of how to set up and run any module in GTAM using the steps outlined in Confluence.
Run through the same process for all other modules in GTAM.
Address any challenges or issues encountered during the setup.
Local Token File Setup:

Create a reusable local token file for Windows across all modules.
Utilize default values for DFR.
Configure the local token file to be used automatically for the development environment.
Set up IntelliJ to pass this file by default, eliminating the need for manual changes or argument passing.
Integration of Tokenization into Gradle Build:

Investigate the feasibility of incorporating tokenization as a Gradle task.
The goal is to simplify the process into a single-step build for any module.
If we achieve this and encounter no challenges, the local setup process will be reduced to just 1 or 2 clicks.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
