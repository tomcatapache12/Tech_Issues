We agree that adopting RefStack end-to-end is the right long-term approach, given its advantages in manageability, versioning, and platform alignment. However, considering our current timelines and the foundational work already completed, we propose prioritizing RefStack integration for authentication and authorization first, as that piece is still pending.

For the rest of the stack, where a working POC exists, we suggest proceeding with the current implementation and addressing remaining changes — such as introducing wrappers — during the final MR phase or as part of a structured modernization effort. This allows us to move efficiently while staying aligned with the broader RefStack strategy.
