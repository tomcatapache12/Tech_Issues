Hi [Manager’s Name],

Yes, this task is already part of our roadmap, and we are actively working on it. We’ve already picked it up, and Vinay is assigned to this initiative. The solution we’re building is aligned with the unified approach we've applied for Mosaic to ensure consistency across the platform.

The task is being tackled in two main parts:

We’re planning to leverage Splunk Alerts for monitoring.
For the prober solution, we’re thinking of utilizing a Prometheus endpoint for our backend processes. We’ll provide more detailed information once we finalize and complete our approach.
We’ll provide an update once we start implementing these changes. Let me know if you need further details in the meantime.

Best regards,
Angad
