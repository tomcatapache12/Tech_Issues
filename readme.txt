ubject: Recurring Issue with Document Service – Missing Required Documents

Hi [MD's Name],

As discussed, I wanted to summarize the recurring issue we’re facing with the Document Service.

We’ve consistently observed cases where required documents are not being returned from the Document Service, resulting in downstream issues and manual escalations. This has become a pattern and needs attention.

The job responsible for fetching documents uses both ShareClass ID and PB Number as fallback identifiers. Despite this logic being in place, we're still seeing failures in retrieving the necessary documents.

The most recent occurrence was for ShareClass ID: zyz.

It may be worth engaging the Document Service team for a deeper investigation and to work toward a long-term fix. I’m happy to help with documenting these cases and creating a runbook until a permanent solution is implemented.

Best regards,
Angad
