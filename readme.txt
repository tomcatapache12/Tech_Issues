As per our discussion with the SS Team, in current failure scenarios:

The SS Team receives a call from the client and places the trade directly with the TA, depending on whether it's onshore or offshore.

For offshore trades, the SS Team prepares a file (based on required lookups) and uploads it to the TA UI.

For onshore trades, the process is mostly manual â€” trades are entered one by one directly into the TA system.

There is a TIP file mechanism available for onshore (SS&C), but it is used in a limited way today since it is picked on a scheduled basis, reducing its effectiveness in time-sensitive scenarios.
