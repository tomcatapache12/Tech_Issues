Hi team,
Sharing a quick summary of next steps for the intern project. Please feel free to suggest additions or changes.

We'll list expected metrics separately for Coordinator and Worker roles – this will help in tracking and evaluating contributions more effectively.

Complete the basic local setup for gtam-uplift so we can test and iterate independently.

We can reuse the existing service port and expose the logic through a separate endpoint.

Scope clarification – we’ll finalize the target services, tentatively starting with what Nitesh had mentioned.

Required changes will be made in the common config, which will be shared across workers for consistency and reusability.

Let me know your thoughts.
