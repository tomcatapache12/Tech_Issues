This task isn't specifically assigned to me; I was just distributing it at a high level since the usage is found in both GTAM and external vendor-related services. It can be picked up by the appropriate pod. If TechRisk can take it up, that works well, but it can also be handled by any relevant team, including GTAM.

I am leaving this decision to the respective pod leads to determine the best ownership. Please feel free to proceed accordingly.
