Description:
We are working on integrating the existing SRE solution with GTAM backend processes to ensure consistent monitoring and health checks across the platform. This task is part of our existing roadmap for SRE and DevEx.

Scope of Work:
Splunk Alerts:

Leverage Splunk Alerts for real-time monitoring and issue detection.
Prober Solution:

Plan to integrate a prober solution using a Prometheus endpoint for GTAM backend processes.
Finalize the approach and provide detailed information once the solution is confirmed.
Owner: Vinay
Priority: Medium
Labels: SRE, DevEx, Monitoring, GTAM
Acceptance Criteria:
Splunk Alerts are configured and functioning for GTAM backend processes.
Prometheus-based prober solution is integrated and monitoring backend health.
