Subject: Update on GTAMP Local Setup Strategy

Dear Payal,

I hope this email finds you well.

I wanted to provide an update on the progress of the strategy for running GTAMP locally. Out of the twelve modules, Iâ€™m pleased to share that eight are now successfully running locally. The local setup is ready for the GTAMP team to begin using, and I encourage them to start building and testing their services within this environment.

The GTAMP team, led by Hermit and Trupti, can now proceed with using this local setup. They should be able to rely on the modules that are functioning, and if any issues arise, they can let us know so we can address them promptly.

We are continuing to work on the remaining modules and are making steady progress in resolving the challenges there.

A special thanks to Kushtar for all the heavy lifting and support in bringing this strategy to fruition. Their efforts have been invaluable in getting us to this point.

Looking forward to the next steps and hearing any feedback the team may have.

Best regards,
Angad
