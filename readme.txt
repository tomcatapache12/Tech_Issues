I have built an OKR framework for the Mosaic UI Down scenario, covering key objectives, associated tasks, and expected outcomes. The OKRs outline a structured approach to designing a scalable contingency framework, handling trade inbound and outbound cases, ensuring secure authentication, and establishing monitoring and recovery mechanisms.

We can walk through the OKRs and tasks to identify the top KPIs that align with our goals. This will help us define measurable outcomes and track progress effectively. We will continue to refine and expand the OKRs as the project evolves and based on fulfillment.

You can find the detailed OKR document in the Confluence link below:

Happy to discuss this further in detail tomorrow.
