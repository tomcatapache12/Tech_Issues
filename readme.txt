GS Fund (Mosaic System Reconciliation):
When the PA system is down for GS funds, the team manually evaluates the net flow or net value for any trade and informs the Portfolio Managers (PMs). Currently, this reconciliation process is manual, and the post-reconciliation capability is handled manually as well. The team follows a set of steps to perform this reconciliation, ensuring that the trades are accurately processed despite the PA system being unavailable.

Non-GS Fund (Mosaic System Reconciliation):
For non-GS funds, when the TA system goes down, trades are directly placed at Calastone. Once the TA system resumes, the messages that were queued during the downtime are sent to TA. To prevent these trades from being transmitted to Calastone again, they are controlled through a "trade TFA screen," which ensures that manually transmitted trades aren't re-sent to Calastone. Upon resumption of the TA system, the team manually reconciles the transactions, marking them as successful once they are entered into the TFA screen, completing the reconciliation process.
