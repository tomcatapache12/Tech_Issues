OKR Theme	OKR Statement	Context/Details	Non-Negotiable	Negotiable/Flexible
Stability, Monitoring & Health Checks	All core services should have a heartbeat, health check & structured observability	- Identify missing heartbeats
- Onboard infra to SRE repo
- Splunk & API-based checks
- Grafana alerts
- Jaeger integration
- Request ID in logs
- Good log coverage	âœ… Heartbeat & health check for all core services
âœ… Grafana alerting
âœ… Request ID in logs
âœ… Jaeger integration	ðŸ”¹ Centralized dashboard
ðŸ”¹ Advanced alerting rules
ðŸ”¹ Enhanced log structure
Performance, Scalability & Reliability	End-to-end critical flows should be tested for capacity & resilience	- Define scope & targets
- Strategy for services & web perf testing
- Load tests for backend & UI
- Guardrails in performance tests
- Blast radius reduction (GTEM/Mosaic)	âœ… Performance test strategy & execution
âœ… Backend & UI load testing
âœ… QA ownership of performance
âœ… GTEM process split across multiple hosts	ðŸ”¹ Synchronous vs. async test tools
ðŸ”¹ Further redundancy measures
CI/CD, Environments & Deployment Stability	Stable & scalable environments with clean CI/CD practices	- QA, Perf & UAT stability
- External connectivity for UAT
- Separate demo env for product team
- GitLab-based deployment for GTEM & Trade Service
- Non-prod deployment cleanliness	âœ… Stable QA, Perf, UAT environments
âœ… CI/CD pipeline optimizations
âœ… Clean automated deployments	ðŸ”¹ Demo environment setup
ðŸ”¹ Separate performance environment
Contingency & Incident Recovery	Mosaic core flows should have contingency mode	- Identify core contingency flows
- Design & implement contingency plans
- Deploy solutions first in non-prod, then prod	âœ… Contingency strategy for core flows
âœ… Non-prod testing of contingency solutions	ðŸ”¹ Additional redundancy layers
Modernization & Tech Debt Cleanup	Legacy systems should be removed & replaced	- Apache migration to Kong
- CGI script alternatives
- Angular to React
- Experience API decommission
- GitLab repo cleanup	âœ… Apache decommissioned
âœ… Experience API removed
âœ… Kong gateway in place	ðŸ”¹ Further GitLab repo cleanup
ðŸ”¹ Full React migration timeline
Standardization & Dependency Management	Consistent dependencies & artifacts across platforms	- Identify common artifacts
- Use BOM for consistency
- Ensure artifact stability across services	âœ… Core artifacts standardized
âœ… BOM usage enforced	ðŸ”¹ Standardization beyond core services
