Hi [Name],

Thanks for highlighting the need around OpenAPI and request/response logging for the Trait service.

Building on that, I’d like to propose a platform-wide approach where we extend our existing core library to provide reusable support for:

🔹 OpenAPI (Swagger) Integration
Preconfigured Springdoc + Swagger setup for consistent and auto-generated API documentation.

Services can override metadata such as title, description, version, and contact details as needed.

🔹 Request/Response Logging Filter
A standardized filter to log incoming requests and outgoing responses in a structured, uniform format.

Supports toggling via configuration and can include correlation ID propagation for traceability.

🔍 Key Benefits
Promotes consistency and observability across all Spring Boot services.

Reduces duplication of boilerplate code and improves maintainability.

Makes it easier for new services to adopt best practices out-of-the-box.

We can implement this in a way that’s opt-in and non-intrusive, with flexibility for each service to enable or override the defaults as required.

Let me know your thoughts — happy to collaborate on defining the initial structure and rollout strategy.

Best regards,
Angad
Platform Lead
