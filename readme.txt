Subject: Request for Early Exit – Notice Period Reduction

Dear [Manager's Name],

As I am currently serving my notice period, I wanted to check if it would be possible to adjust my last working day. Currently, the termination date is showing as 18th October, but I would like to request an early release, ideally by Friday, 26th September, considering my personal circumstances.

My mother's health has been a concern for the past 6–7 months. We had been hoping for improvement, but the recent diagnosis suggests that she will now require lifelong treatment. This has made it necessary for me to step in and support her more actively, including time-sensitive planning and coordination in Delhi.

I have been fully committed to my responsibilities during my notice period and will continue to provide complete support for a smooth handover. I would like to understand what options might be available for an early exit — whether through leave adjustment, buyout, or any other flexibility the firm can provide.

I sincerely hope for your understanding during this challenging time and am happy to discuss this further.

Warm regards,
[Your Name]
