Subject: Availability for Business Checkout â€“ Thursday, 8:30 AM IST

Hi Renee and Thomas,

I am planning to run the AutoSuggest job and would like to have a quick business checkout before or afterward. Could you please confirm if someone from the SS team will be available at 8:30 AM IST on Thursday?

We just need to compare the share class link content before and after the job run to ensure everything looks as expected.

Please let me know if this timing works for you or if we need to adjust.

Thanks,
Angad

Subject: Sign-off Request for Autosys Job Release

Hi Ishaan and Renee,

We are planning to release the Autosys job in production, and I wanted to check if everything is in place and we are good to go.

Once we have your sign-off, I will plan to trigger the job. Please let me know if we have any open questions.

Thanks,
Angad
