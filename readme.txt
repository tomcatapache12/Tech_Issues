Request for Consideration on Termination Date Adjustment

Hi Tejas,

Following up on our discussion, I wanted to share more details regarding my situation and seek your guidance on the possibility of adjusting my termination date to 29th September.

My mother is undergoing treatment for a lymph node issue in her lungs, and she needs my presence and support during this challenging time. I have secured a 100% remote opportunity with a joining date of 29th September, which will allow me to be with her while continuing my professional growth.

The new employer has already been very accommodating by granting me more than two months’ delay, but unfortunately, due to their internal constraints, they cannot extend the start date beyond September. Given this, I’m hoping to explore any possible flexibility from GS’s side to set my termination date as 29th September.

I fully understand there may be process complexities, and I have already discussed this with Manas, whom I’ve kept in CC to evaluate options together.

Please let me know if you need any additional details from me. I sincerely appreciate your understanding and support during this time.

Best regards,
Angad
